### Challenge: Sustaining Our Planet for Future Generations
There is concern worldwide that environmental issues we face today will have an impact on future generations. Your challenge is to create a way to communicate the importance of environmental responsibility to people of all ages.

## Team Endeavor
Team Endeavor is a group of Computer Science students.

This project aims at creating a web based visual novel about the problems 
our planet probably will encounter if people won't be careful.
Our character Mirai sends us a message through space and time, 
and tells us what happened to the Earth because of the ignorance.
